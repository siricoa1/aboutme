#Introduction

This Application is built on HTML, CSS, and mostly pure Javascript. It utilizes an Node.js/Express Server to run, 
and implements component based architecture to render compoents to the DOM. This is modeled off of React.js, 
but is designed to be as basic as possible for optimization and simplicity. My goal was to see if I could create 
a similar component based architecture on my own using vanilla Javascript.
