# Introduction

This Application is built on HTML, CSS, and mostly pure Javascript. It utilizes a Node.js/Express Server to run, 
and implements component based architecture to render compoents to the DOM. This is designed to be as basic as possible for 
optimization and simplicity. My goal was to see if I could create a similar component based architecture to other popular
libraries on my own using vanilla Javascript.
